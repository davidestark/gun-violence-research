This repository contains detailed methods and annotated code associated with [Stark DE, Shah NH. Funding and Publication of Research on Gun Violence and Other Leading Causes of Death. *JAMA*. 2017;317(1):84-85](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2016.16215) and enables fully reproducible research.
  
The script `gun_violence_annotated_code.Rmd` is an [R Markdown document](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and should be run within the same working directory as the accompanying file, `Compressed Mortality, 2004-2014.txt`. Internet access is required, as the code will retrieve data from the MEDLINE and Federal RePORTER databases. Running this `.Rmd` script in RStudio will take approximately 4-6 hours to complete on a standard machine. The completed output is `gun_violence_annotated_code.pdf`
